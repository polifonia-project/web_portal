## Mapping

If available include the mapping to an ontology term (classes and properties). Include prefixes here:

```
@prefix dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/> .
@prefix mo: <http://purl.org/ontology/mo/> .
```

Add an icon to flag important/secondary/less important ones.

:lion: the king of the dataset

:koala: secondary aspect, but too cute to leave behind

:duck: I don't know if it is important
